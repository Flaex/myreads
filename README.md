# MyReads Project

This is my version for Myreads project for Udacity Front-end nanodegree program. The objective is to build an application that connects to an API to search, fetch and set books on 3 different shelves.

# Backend Server
The original starter template includes a backend server which provides the API. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend
* [`getAll`]
* [`update`]
* [`search`]

## Installling
To run successfully the backend and frontend applications it is required to have node.js installed on the system.
* [`npm install`]. To install required node modules and dependencies

## Running
To start the backend server and open the front-end application on the default browser, navigate to you project on command prompt and type the following command
* [`npm start`]

## Using the App
* [`Main page`] The main page will show 3 shelves (Currently reading, Want to read and Read) containing books. By default, the API will set some books on the shelves, you can change or remove them as well clicking on the ▼ icon and choosing an option on the dropdown list.

* [`Search Page`] This view will show the search results. Here you can add new book to shelves or also change or remove them as well clicking on the ▼ icon and choosing an option on the dropdown list.
